	<h4>How to Play</h4>

	<p>The deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero.  The ranks in each color are 0 through 9, &quot;Skip,&quot; &quot;Draw Two,&quot; and &quot;Reverse.&quot;  In addition, the deck contains four &quot;Wild&quot; and &quot;Wild Draw Four&quot; cards.</p>

	<p>Seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the deck is flipped over and set aside to start the discard pile. A player takes their turn by discarding one card that matches the top of the discard pile in color and/or rank.  If the player has no matching cards, they must draw the top card from the deck and play it if possible; otherwise, they must pass.</p>

	<h4>House Rules</h4>

	<p>Players are allowed to stack multiple cards in one turn, only if they are of the <strong>same rank</strong>. This is commonly referred to as stacking.  For example, if a player has a hand that consists of a <strong>red 4, blue 4, green 4,</strong> red 5, blue 6, green 9, and blue 2, he is allowed to play the red, blue, and green 4 at one time.</p>

	<p>In addition to stacking, players are able to counter/transfer draw cards.  That is, when a &quot;draw two&quot; is played, the next player gets the opportunity to play another draw two (if they have one), passing an additional 2+2 penalty onto the next player.  Counters can only be done using the <strong>same rank</strong>. A player cannot counter two &quot;draw twos&quot; using a &quot;draw four.&quot;</p>
